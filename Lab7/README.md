In this chapter we learn about the brute force attempt at decrypting. We see with the rail cypher how it works for a simple 
program and learn how to make it better later on. we also go back to the substitution cipher and understand how it works with randomly assigned letters and how the basics of human speech can help us solve them. we end with regular expressin syntax and module functions.
