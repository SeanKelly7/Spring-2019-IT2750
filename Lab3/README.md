In chapter 3 we learn about cyphers. We get a brief history and then are shown how to code certian cyphers like the rail cypher or the substitution cypher. Also, we are introduced to the summary of string methods and string operators, different methods used to return different formats of the string we used.
5. center astring.center(w): places spaces around the string
    ljust astring.ljust(w): justifies the string to the left
    lower astring.lower(): turns all characters in the string to lowercase
6. The ASCII formula changes the letters to numbers or vice versa.
    The Transposition cipher, or rail cipher, takes all even characters in one group and all odd characters into another group, this also includes spaces.
    The substitution cipher takes the letters you input and replaces them with another letter from a different string of letters, the letter is replaced with another in the same spot in the other string.
7. the formula is a substitution cipher
8. the formula is a rail cipher
